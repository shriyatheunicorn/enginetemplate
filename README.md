# Stagehand + Browserbase: Deep Research Agent

## AT A GLANCE

- Goal: build a cited research brief from the open web using Browserbase Search API for discovery, Fetch API for fast page retrieval, and Stagehand browser sessions only when needed.
- Search-first: runs several targeted web searches and deduplicates candidate URLs.
- Fetch-first: retrieves raw page content without launching a browser, parses HTML locally, and scores usable sources.
- Browser fallback: escalates JS-heavy, blocked, very thin, or oversized pages to a Stagehand session with AI-powered extraction.
- Plan-first research: creates an explicit research plan before searching, including assumptions, evidence requirements, source-quality rules, and risky-source hints.
- AutoBrowse-inspired learning loop: writes traces, evaluates quality, improves `strategy.md`, and runs another pass with one concrete hypothesis per iteration.
- Claim-level evidence: extracts claim candidates from every usable source, not just page summaries.
- Live web enrichment: records search snapshots, retrieval timestamps, content hashes, excerpt hashes, and source snippets so live-web runs are auditable after pages drift.
- Universal-verifier stage: creates a rubric before retrieval, then separately scores research process and final report outcome after synthesis.
- FARA/WebTailBench-style benchmark mode: runs a TSV/JSON/JSONL task suite, preserves precomputed rubrics when present, and emits JSONL plus aggregate metrics.
- Synthesis: uses Stagehand through Browserbase Model Gateway to produce a structured brief with source IDs, claim map, confidence notes, contradictions, gaps, and follow-up questions.

## QUICKSTART

1. cd stagehand-browserbase-deep-research-agent
2. npm install
3. cp .env.example .env
4. Add BROWSERBASE_API_KEY to .env
5. npm start -- "What changed in browser automation platforms in 2026?"

## BENCHMARK MODE

Set `BENCH_TASKS_FILE` to run a FARA/WebTailBench-style task suite instead of one topic:

```bash
BENCH_TASKS_FILE=./benchmark.example.tsv BENCH_TASK_LIMIT=1 npm run bench
```

Supported task formats:

- WebTailBench-style TSV with `id`, `task_summary`, `benchmark`, `init_url`, and optional `precomputed_rubric`.
- JSON array or `{ "tasks": [...] }`.
- JSONL with one task object per line.

Recognized task fields:

- `id`, `task_id`, or `subdir`
- `question`, `task_summary`, `confirmed_task`, or `instruction`
- `category`, `benchmark`, or `split`
- `init_url` or `website`
- `precomputed_rubric` or `precomputedRubric`

Benchmark outputs:

- `bench-output/bench-results-<timestamp>.jsonl`
- `bench-output/bench-summary-<timestamp>.json`
- one normal research workspace per task

## HOW IT WORKS

1. Creates a per-run workspace under `research-workspace/<topic>-<timestamp>/`.
2. Builds `plan.md` with assumptions, report sections, required evidence, search queries, and source-quality rules.
3. Builds `rubric.md` before retrieval, separating process criteria from outcome criteria.
4. Writes an initial `strategy.md` with a fast path, source quality rules, fallback rules, and stop criteria.
5. Builds query variants from the current strategy.
6. Calls `bb.search.web()` for each query.
7. Deduplicates candidate URLs and prioritizes strategy-selected browser fallback URLs.
8. Calls `bb.fetchAPI.create()` for each candidate.
9. Parses usable HTML with Cheerio and extracts title, metadata, headings, links, word count, excerpts, quality signals, risk flags, and claim candidates.
10. Falls back to a Stagehand browser session for pages that need JavaScript, are blocked, are too thin, or return unusable content.
11. Runs a hot-path quality evaluation covering source count, domain diversity, claim count, missing angles, and risk flags.
12. Writes JSON and Markdown traces for the iteration.
13. Enriches accepted and rejected sources with live-web metadata: search snapshot, retrieval method, timestamps, status/content type, hashes, snippets, and fallback reasons.
14. Reads the trace with a Strategy Planner and updates `strategy.md` for the next iteration.
15. Synthesizes the top diverse sources into a report.
16. Verifies the process and outcome against `rubric.md`, classifies controllable vs uncontrollable failures, and writes final Markdown/JSON under both the run workspace and `output/`.

## WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT

Most research templates are one of three shapes: search-and-summarize, multi-agent fanout, or browser-only exploration. This template is built around a different loop:

- It treats Browserbase Search and Fetch as the cheap, high-throughput research substrate, then spends full browser sessions only when diagnostics justify it.
- It adapts the AutoBrowse trace loop to research, so each pass records what failed and improves one strategy hypothesis.
- It preserves claim candidates, reliability signals, and prompt-injection risk flags before synthesis.
- It generates a verifier rubric before seeing results, avoiding post-hoc grading bias.
- It can import benchmark `precomputed_rubric` data, matching the reproducibility direction used by FARA/WebTailBench.
- It separately scores the research process and final report outcome, then classifies repairable vs access-related failures.
- It enforces source diversity with `MAX_SOURCES_PER_DOMAIN`, reducing the common failure mode where one domain dominates the report.
- It upgrades traceability into live web enrichment by preserving the retrieval context, snippets, and hashes behind each source.
- It produces auditable artifacts: `plan.md`, `rubric.md`, `strategy.md`, per-iteration traces, `verification.md`, final Markdown, and final JSON.
- It can stop early on quality thresholds or keep iterating for higher confidence.

## AUTOBROWSE PATTERN

This template adapts the AutoBrowse loop from site automation to research:

- Inner loop: Search, Fetch, browser fallback, source scoring, and trace writing.
- Outer loop: read the trace, identify the failure mode, form one improvement hypothesis, update strategy, and repeat.
- Strategy memory: `strategy.md` preserves what worked, browser fallback URLs, source quality rules, and recovery heuristics.
- Durable evidence: every iteration writes `traces/iteration-N.json` and `traces/iteration-N.md`.
- Final report: the report cites source IDs and includes contradictions, gaps, source quality notes, and follow-up questions.

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Console progress for search, fetch, fallback, and synthesis steps.
- `research-workspace/<topic>-<timestamp>/plan.md` with the initial research plan.
- `research-workspace/<topic>-<timestamp>/rubric.md` with process and outcome verification criteria.
- `research-workspace/<topic>-<timestamp>/strategy.md` with the evolving strategy.
- `research-workspace/<topic>-<timestamp>/traces/iteration-N.json` and `.md` files.
- `research-workspace/<topic>-<timestamp>/verification.md` with pass/fail, process score, outcome score, unsupported claims, weak citations, and repair actions.
- A Markdown report with methodology, executive summary, key findings, claim map, contradictions, gaps, follow-up questions, and source list.
- A JSON file containing the topic, generated queries, scored sources, live-web enrichment metadata, and structured report object.

## RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT

This repo includes a small web server in `server.ts` and a `railway.json` start command.

1. Create a new Railway project from this GitHub repo.
2. Add `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` in the Railway service Variables tab.
3. Start command is already set to `npm run web` by `railway.json`.
4. For a lower-cost first deploy, set these Railway variables:
   - `RESEARCH_ITERATIONS=1`
   - `NUM_QUERIES=2`
   - `RESULTS_PER_QUERY=3`
   - `MAX_FETCHES=4`
   - `MAX_BROWSER_FALLBACKS=1`
   - `USE_RESEARCH_PLANNER=false`
   - `USE_STRATEGY_PLANNER=false`
   - `USE_BROWSER_SYNTHESIS=false`
   - `USE_VERIFIER=false`

Railway provides `PORT` automatically. The web server exposes `/health` for health checks.

## COMMON PITFALLS

- Missing API key: verify `.env` contains `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY`.
- Search query length: Search API queries must be 1 to 200 characters. This template trims generated queries.
- Search result volume: Search API supports 1 to 25 results per query. This template clamps `RESULTS_PER_QUERY`.
- Live web drift: traces and live-web enrichment make runs auditable, but exact page replay still requires external archiving if you need full raw-page snapshots.
- Fetch API does not execute JavaScript. Thin app-shell pages should fall back to Stagehand.
- Fetch API has a 1 MB content limit and 10 second timeout. Use browser sessions for large or slow pages.
- More iterations cost more because each improvement pass may use Search, Fetch, browser fallback, and Model Gateway calls.
- Keep `MAX_BROWSER_FALLBACKS` low at first. The template is designed to spend browser sessions only after Fetch produces useful diagnostics.
- Prompt injection can appear inside web pages. This template flags suspicious text and instructs synthesis to treat page content as evidence, never instructions.
- Cursor Bugbot reviews pull requests, not the full repository on demand. Enable it in the Cursor dashboard and comment `bugbot run` on a PR to trigger a review that uses `.cursor/BUGBOT.md`.
- Source diversity is a guardrail, not a guarantee. For regulated or high-stakes use, add domain allowlists and human review.
- Synthesis quality depends on source quality. Tune query variants, source scoring, and domain filters for production workflows.

## USE CASES

- Competitive research: gather recent pages, source snippets, and a quick cited brief.
- Due diligence: collect public web evidence before escalating to authenticated or paid sources.
- Monitoring: schedule recurring research over a topic and compare source changes over time.
- Agent pipelines: let Search and Fetch do cheap triage before spending browser and model budget.

## OTHER BROWSERBASE TOOLS WORTH ADDING

- Browser Sessions: use Playwright or Stagehand when a page requires JavaScript, interaction, downloads, or authenticated browsing.
- Stagehand `observe`: inspect available page actions before deciding whether to click or extract.
- Contexts: persist login state for authenticated research sources.
- Proxies: get geography-specific results or improve access to protected pages.
- Browser Settings: use advanced stealth, ad blocking, and captcha solving for difficult browser fallback targets.
- Functions: deploy this research agent as an API endpoint or scheduled job on Browserbase infrastructure.
- Browserbase Skills and CLI: useful if you want coding agents to run search, fetch, browser, and deployment workflows consistently.
- AutoBrowse: use the full skill when you need to train reliable browser workflows for specific sites, then graduate those workflows into reusable skills.
